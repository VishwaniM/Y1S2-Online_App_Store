				Requested a chrome extension to share web pages via telegram with just one click,and since this is a very easy task, i programed one.And also If we as the consumer are able to choose the location where the file could be downloaded, it would be convenient. Like a default location and an optional location to be somewhere in the options.

				Please add an option on what profile you are going to use when interacting. Eg. If you are an admin of someone else's page and you still want to interact(react, send stars, comment) using your own profile(not the page's), it shouldn't be always the page's profile that should be used. Please add, because I'm so frustrated right now that I can't send stars and react (using my own profile) to the page I'm supporting.

				only annoying thing is when there are updates. All other apps let us know what updates we are getting. This is a paid service and I would like to know what is being updated. Really annoying when I see that "You worry what to watch next..." message next to my updates. I want to know what you are updating.
