		<h4>Telegram</h4>
		<div class="desc">Telegram was really my favorite messengerâ€Œ.It had almost a lot of features......it still has ..... but it has been bothering me lately ..... I saw some problems ..... problems like not sending the video even after the full volume of the video is uploaded .. ... and the problem of not connecting the telegram if it was not related to anything ..... even the Internet.</div>

		<h4>whats app</h4>
		<div class="desc">Awesome app! Best place to talk to your friend! The only thing that could be improved is the call and video call, its too glitchy. But over all such a good app to use! ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’– you can send videos, locations, photos, links, music and much more!!! Totally reccomend this app if someone wants to talk ro their family or friends! ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’– oh! And btw you can also send GIFs and more! ðŸ’–ðŸ’–ðŸ’–</div>

		<h4>Netflix</h4>
		<div class="desc">It's amazing, we can watch so many shows from Nickelodeon to Disney and not even that we can watch original series and movies from netflix. Yes sometimes it glitches but that's usually because of my phones storage space being full and sometime videos do not play and I am told to try again later but that's usually because of my internet but overall it stupendous and amazing and really easy to use and it has such a wide range of genres and shows. Thx for this great app.</div>

		<h4>facebook</h4>
		<div class="desc">FaceBook is an interesting form of using a computer or bot. You can post and share personal pictures and thoughts. I would rate this app PG-13. As soon as you get Facebook, think conversion. More than enough settings, the app-linkthrough feature is useful when logging in to other accounts. So much has been said about this app; it is compatible with OkCupid, Bumble, Stumbleupon, Twitter and SoundCloud and other outside sources.</div>

		<h4>Viber</h4>
		<div class="desc">Perfect platform for messaging. even video calls. And it does not consume a lot of bandwidth to get your message across. Perfect for those who only rely on mobile data to connect. A very flexible app and very reliable which leads me to wonder why others would still prefer other platforms.</div>
