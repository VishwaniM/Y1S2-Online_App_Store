It has a massive 6.67-inch ‘Fluid AMOLED’ display with a QHD+ resolution, 90Hz refresh rate and support for HDR 10+ content. The display produces vivid colours, deep blacks and has good viewing angles.The phone uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, which is said to be more power efficient than the previous one. Performance is excellent as the phone can handle heavy apps and games with ease. The new OxygenOS 9.5 debuts some new features such as Fnatic mode for prioritising games over notifications, an in-built screen recording, screenshot editor and more.  ";}
